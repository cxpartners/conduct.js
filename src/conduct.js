/**
* Main conduct function.
* For a given array of media queries and callbacks, we will register a resize event and test the media queries,
* applying and unapplying the relevant callbacks at each point.
*
* @param Object breakpoints
*   Object containing an Array (media_queries) of callbacks and media queries in the following format and
*   an optional Number (timeout) to supply a debounce delay in milliseconds.
*    {
*     'media_queries': [
*       {
*         query: 'max-width: 600px',
*         match: function() {
*           // This code will run when this media query moves from an unmatched state to a matched state
*         },
*         unmatch: function() {
*           // This code will run when this media query moves from a matched state to an unmatched state
*         }
*       },
*       {
*         query: 'min-width: 601px',
*         match: function() {
*           // This code will run when this media query moves from an unmatched state to a matched state
*         },
*         unmatch: function() {
*           // This code will run when this media query moves from a matched state to an unmatched state
*         }
*       },
*     ],
*      'timeout': 250
*    }
* Important note: The order that these callbacks appear in the array is important.
* When resizing *up*, the callbacks will be unmatched and matched in an ascending order.
* When resizing *down*, the callbacks will be unmatched and matched in a descending order.
* The logic behind this is that you tend to want to unmatch a "desktop" breakpoint before matching
* a "mobile" breakpoint.
